# Bitwase React Native test app 

## Instalation

If you have yarn and MacOS run
```
make init
```
When that is over I usually open separate terminal window and run `yarn start --verbose` (`--verbose is optional) to monitor better hotreload process
Ather that the app can be run 
```
yarn ios
```
or
```
yarn android
```
I prefer iOs as development enviroment
